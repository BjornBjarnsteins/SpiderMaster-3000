#The SpiderStack will be for each of the 10 columns in play. 
#It will have the following traits:
#Number of cards in the Stack
#Number of hidden cards in the deck (those will be at the front of the array, we'll use the class variable variable 'hidden' for this)
#location on the board as well as length


#Methods:

#to flip a hidden card if nothing else is on top:
#def flip():

#to add a new spiderstack (moved from somewhere else) to this one (IF it is a legal move):
#def add():

#to remove a part of the spiderstack, one card or more, from this stack
#def remove():
